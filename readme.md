# Minimal Highcharts Setup With Elm

This repo shows how you can render a [Highcharts chart](https://www.highcharts.com/) with Elm. It uses [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) to allow Elm to create and interact with a chart.

## Run locally

To run this locally you need node installed on your machine. Node can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Clone this repo then run `npm install`.

Start a dev server with `npm start`.

- This will start webpack dev server and serve the project with live reloading and elm debugger enabled

Create a build for your server with `npm run build`

- This will bundle files into the dist folder.
